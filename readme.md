# rotating cube

a multi-colored cube hovering and spinning in 3d space, written in rust using
the Bevy game engine.

## why?

I'm trying to learn rust, and saw that Bevy was a game engine where everything
is code (no gui) which I thought was cool. I just wanted to get a basic cube to
rotate in order to familiarize myyself with the transformation tool and ecs
system. I used the 3d example
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/3d/3d_shapes.rs
as a starter point
